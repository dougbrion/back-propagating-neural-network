Testing neural network in C++

## What is a Neural network
A Neural Network (ANN) is a paradigm inspired by the way biological systems process information, such as animal brains, working by using loads of interconnected neurons forming a giant network. The key element of this paradigm, like the brain it is imitating, is the novel structure of the information processing system - composed of many interconnected 'neurons' working in unison to solve specific problems. Computer based (Artificial) Neural Networks, like the brain, learn by example. A NN is specialised for a specific application, such as image processing or data classification. The brain learns by adjusting synaptic connexions between the neurons, this is also how artificial neural networks work.

## About this ANN
This ANN is implemented in C++ using just standard libraries and no NN libraries. The two main structures of this program consist of the class *neuron* and the class *network*. In these objects we have the necessary variables and functions in order to form most of our network.
